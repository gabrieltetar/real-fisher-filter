<title> Bessel Cutoff Frequency </title>

<h1> Bessel Cutoff Frequency </h1>

Before today, my ``mkfilter'' web page
gave you a filter whose magnitude response differed from 0.707 (-3dB) at the
cutoff frequency you specified.	 Several people asked me if this was correct. <p>

My standard reply until today was along the lines of ``it depends which
textbook you read'', although I think I made it sound more convincing than that. <p>

I've now changed the pole-finding program according to the procedure given in Van Valkenburg,
<a href=//www.cs.york.ac.uk/books/cgi-bin/findbook?0030592461><i>Analog filter design</i></a> (1982).
This differs from any of the other text-books I consulted (!) but it does appear to be sound,
and it does give a corner-frequency gain which is very close to -3dB, if the bilinear
transform is used. <p>

Be warned therefore that if you re-design a Bessel filter using ``mkfilter''
you will get different results from those you got before.  The difference is
more pronounced at higher orders.  The shape of the response is unchanged. <p>

I hope this is more of a help than a hindrance. <p>
