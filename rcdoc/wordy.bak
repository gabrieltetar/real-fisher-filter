<CHAP < Raised Cosine Filters >

{ A ^r^a^i^s^e^d ^c^o^s^i^n^e ^f^i^l^t^e^r is a low-pass filter which is commonly used for
pulse shaping in data transmission systems (e.g. modems). }

{ Let /t be the
duration of a baud, so the baud rate is 1//t symbols per second.  The
frequency response of a raised cosine filter is symmetrical about 0_Hz,
and is divided into three parts:

<tabs 4m 6m 20m

lpar ^f -- {{ 1 -- /b over 2/t }} rpar rpar rpar \t for _ {{ 1 -- /b over
2/t }} _<=_ ^f _<=_ {{ 1 + /b over 2/t }} \g (1) >

< \t || >
< \t |3 \t 0 \t for _ ^f _>=_ {{ 1 + /b over 2/t }} \g >

{ The parameter /b is known as the ^r^o^l^l^-^o^f^f ^f^a^c^t^o^r or ^e^x^c^e^s^s ^b^a^n^d^w^i^d^t^h.
/b lies between 0 and 1. }

{ The minimum bandwidth needed to transmit a pulse train at 1//t symbols
per second is /a_=_1_/_(2/t)_Hz.  For example, if the baud rate is 2400
and the carrier frequency is 1800, the necessary bandwidth is from 600
to 3000_Hz, and the minimum low-pass filter bandwidth is 1200_Hz.  This
requires a filter with a ``brick-wall'' (square) low-pass response.
That's what you get if you specify /b_=_0.  A ``brick-wall'' filter has
a ``sinc'' impulse response with slowly decaying tails, and is difficult
to implement and generally unsatisfactory. }

{ Non-zero values of /b specify a filter with a less square frequency
response, and a more manageable impulse response.  The rule is that the
filter response (or, alternatively, the transmitted spectrum) stretches
from 0_Hz to (1_+_/b)_/a_Hz.  That's why /b is called the excess
bandwidth:  it specifies the amount by which the filter bandwidth
exceeds the minimum necessary to transmit a pulse train with the
speci-fied baud rate. }

{ The time-domain (impulse) response of a raised cosine filter, obtained
by taking the inverse Fourier transform of the spectrum, can be shown to
be:

<EQN
< ^x(^t) _=_ lpar sinc {{ /p^t over /t }} rpar _ lpar {{ cos /p/b^t / /t
over 1 -- (2/b^t / /t)/2 }} rpar \g (2) >
>EQN }

{ In a modem, the raised cosine frequency response is divided equally
between the transmitter and the receiver.  Each contains an identical
filter whose magnitude response is given by the square root of
eqn._(1), normalized so that the maximum remains /t.  This is called a
^r^o^o^t ^r^a^i^s^e^d ^c^o^s^i^n^e filter. }

{ The #m#k#s#h#a#p#e program (which is called by the ``mkfilter'' web page)
designs a raised cosine or root raised cosine filter by first using
eqn._(1) to compute the frequency response, then performing an inverse
fast Fourier transform to compute the time-domain (impulse) response.  }
