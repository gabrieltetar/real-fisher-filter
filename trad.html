<title> Butterworth / Bessel / Chebyshev Filters </title>

<h1> Butterworth / Bessel / Chebyshev Filters </h1>

<hr> <p>

This is an interactive filter design package, for designing digital filters
by the bilinear transform or matched <i>z</i>-transform method.
Fill in the form and press the ``Submit'' button, and a filter will be designed for you.

   <li> Select filter type: <br>

	<p> <ul> <table border>
	  <td> <table>
	    <tr> <td> <input type=radio name=filtertype value=Butterworth checked> </td> <td> Butterworth </td> </tr>
	    <tr> <td> <input type=radio name=filtertype value=Bessel>		   </td> <td> Bessel	  </td> </tr>
	    <tr> <td> <input type=radio name=filtertype value=Chebyshev>	   </td> <td> Chebyshev	  </td> </tr>
	  </table> </td>
	  <td> <table>
	    <tr> <td> <input type=radio name=passtype value=Lowpass checked> </td> <td> Lowpass	 </td> </tr>
	    <tr> <td> <input type=radio name=passtype value=Highpass>	     </td> <td> Highpass </td> </tr>
	    <tr> <td> <input type=radio name=passtype value=Bandpass>	     </td> <td> Bandpass </td> </tr>
	    <tr> <td> <input type=radio name=passtype value=Bandstop>	     </td> <td> Bandstop </td> </tr>
	  </table> </td>
	</table> </ul> <p>

   <li> If you specified ``Chebyshev'' above, enter ripple in dB here: <input name=ripple> <br>

	<p> <ul> <small>
	   (The ripple, if specified, must be a negative number.
	   For other filter types, leave this field blank.)
	</small> </ul> </p>

   <li> Enter the filter order: <input name=order> <br>

	<p> <ul> <small>
	   (For lowpass and highpass, this is the number of poles.
	   For bandpass and bandstop, the number of poles is twice the order.)
	</small> </ul> </p>

   <li> Sample rate, in samples per second: <input name=samplerate> <br>

	<p>

   <li> Enter corner frequency/ies, in Hz. <p>

	Corner frequency 1: <input name=corner1> Hz <br>
	Corner frequency 2: <input name=corner2> Hz <br>

	<p> <ul> <small>
	   (For Butterworth and Bessel lowpass designs, the corner frequency is the frequency at which the
	   magnitude of the response is -3 dB.	For Chebyshev lowpass designs, the corner frequency is the
	   highest frequency at which the magnitude of the response is equal to the specified ripple.
	   For highpass, bandpass and bandstop, the above definition is modified in an obvious way.
	</small> </ul> </p>

	<p> <ul> <small>
	   For lowpass and highpass, one corner frequency is required:
	   enter this in the first slot and leave the second one blank.
	   For bandpass and bandstop, two corner frequencies are required.)
	</small> </ul> </p>

	<p>

   <li> If you wish, you can add one additional zero at a particular frequency,
	normally in the stop-band, to give infinite attenuation at that frequency.
	For a standard Butterworth / Bessel / Chebyshev design, leave this field blank. <br>
	Additional zero at: <input name=adzero> Hz <br>

	<p>

   <li> By default, the filter is designed by the bilinear transform method, which is
	<i>recommended</i> for most applications.
	Tick (check) here: <input name=mzt value=yes type=checkbox> and the matched <i>z</i>-transform
	will be used instead.
	<b>Warning:</b> inspect the frequency response carefully if you use this option.
	<a href=mzt.html>Click here</a> for further information about the matched <i>z</i>-transform,
	and about Bessel filters in particular.

	<p>

   <li> By default, the frequency response graph has a <i>linear</i> magnitude scale.
	If that is what you want, leave the following box blank.
	If you want a <i>logarithmic</i> magnitude scale in dB,
	enter the lower limit of the magnitude scale in dB here (e.g. -80). <br>
	Lower limit (dB), or blank for linear scale: <input name=logmin>
