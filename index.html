If you've come here by mistake and are looking for an <i>analogue</i> (LC) filter designer,
look <a href=/~fisher/lcfilter>here</a> instead. <p>

A companion page designs digital (i.e. software)
<a href=../mkpll><b><i>phase-locked loops (PLLs)</i></b></a>. <p>

This is an interactive filter design package, for designing digital filters.
Fill in the form and press the ``Submit'' button, and a filter will be designed for you.
You can specify the following types of filter:

<ul>
   <li> Butterworth, Bessel or Chebyshev infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filters,
	with lowpass, highpass, bandpass or bandstop characteristcis,
	designed by the bilinear transform or matched <i>z</i>-transform method;
   <p>
   <li> IIR bandpass, bandstop (notch) or allpass resonators, designed directly in the <i>z</i>-plane;
   <p>
   <li> finite-impulse-response (FIR) raised-cosine filters, optionally with a square-root response;
   <p>
   <li> FIR Hilbert transformers.
</ul>

I've been advised to say that, although I believe the package to be bug-free,
you use the results at your own peril, and you're advised to check them for
correctness before using them.	Don't blame me if your aircraft falls out of the sky! <p>

The ``C'' code generated by this package is the way it is for pedagogic reasons,
and could easily be ``tightened up''. <p>

The source code (in C++) for the programs that do the work (i.e. not the WWW
front end) is <a href=/~fisher/software/mkfilter> available for browsing or down-loading</a>,
and <a href=/~fisher/software/mkfilter/current/doc.ps.gz>PostScript documentation</a>
for these programs is available.  If your browser uses GhostView to display PostScript,
select ``magstep -1'' and ``paper A4'' for best effect. <p>

The graphs are produced with the help of the excellent
<a href=//www.boutell.com/gd> <tt>gd</tt> GIF manipulation library</a>,
originally from Quest Protein Database Center. <p>

Here are some references to <a href=textbooks.html> textbooks</a>
which will tell you about digital filters, the differences between the various types,
the bilinear transform method, etc. <p>

A companion page generates digital (i.e. software) <a href=../mkpll> phase-locked loops (PLLs)</a>. <p>

An email message, saying what you like and don't like about this package,
will be appreciated. <p>
