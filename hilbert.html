   <p>

   We need to know the sample rate (in samples per second). <br>
   Sample rate: <input name=samplerate size=10>

   <p>

   Enter the length of the finite-impulse response, in samples.
   The larger the value, the more accurate the filter, but the slower its execution. <br>
   Impulse length: <input name=impulselen size=10>

   <p>

   If you are going to execute the generated filter on a fixed-point processor,
   you will want to know how the filter behaves when the coefficents are truncated to <i>n</i> bits.
   To find out, enter the value of <i>n</i> in the box.
   (If you are not interested in this feature, leave the field blank.
   For more information, <a href=trunc.html>click here</a>.) <br>
   Truncate coefficients to <input name=bits size=10> bits

   <p>

   By default, the frequency response graph has a <i>linear</i> magnitude scale.
   If that is what you want, leave the following box blank.
   If you want a <i>logarithmic</i> magnitude scale in dB,
   enter the lower limit of the magnitude scale in dB here (e.g. -80). <br>
   Lower limit (dB), or blank for linear scale: <input name=logmin size=10>
